# data-collection
All code by Ryan Dekker; needed a Google assist to help with using a for loop to take the beautiful soup object into rows of lists. 
Verified that the objects were able to be converted into Pandas dataframes and exported as CSV files.
Gave written analysis to the Martian year cycle in # code commentary
